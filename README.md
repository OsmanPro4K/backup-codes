# Backup Codes
Backup codes is a project that replicates Google's Backup Code system.

# How does it work
During sign up when a user creates an account, 4 codes are generated which can be copied to clipboard (even though it shows I selected them all).

After the user logs in, the backup code is requested. If the user types the correct code, well, successfully goes to a web page, app, etc. use your imagination.

# What I have learned
I have learned to create a security system, if I add password hashing, and separate apps for separate things, maybe I can professionally create a security system for a website.
